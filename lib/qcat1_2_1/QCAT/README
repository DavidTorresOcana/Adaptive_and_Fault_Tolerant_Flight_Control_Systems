This toolbox provides implementations of a number of algorithms for
control allocation based on quadratic optimization that can be found
in the literature.

The toolbox also contains functions specifically related to my own
research:
 o efficient active set methods for real time allocation
 o dynamic control allocation
 o the relationship between control allocation and LQ control

To install the toolbox:

0) Requirements. Developed in Matlab 6.5 running on a Unix platform
   Should work fine also with other configurations (like Matlab 7.0).

1) Download qcat.zip from http://www.control.isy.liu.se/~ola/qcat

2) Extract files in your Matlab repository /home/foo/matlab/ :
      unzip qcat.zip

3) Add the qcat directory to your Matlab path:
      addpath /home/foo/matlab/QCAT/qcat/

4) Compile wlsc_alloc.c. See source code for instructions.

5) Ready to use! For online help try

    >> qcatdoc    [Opens documentation including source code]
